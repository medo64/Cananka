### Cananka ###

Cananka allows for computer control of a CAN bus. Depending on the exact
interface, control is possible via network driver (SocketCAN), serial port
(SLCAN compatible), or both.

Details for each supported hardware interface are available in their respective
read-me file:

* [HAT](HAT/README.md)
* [USB](USB/README.md)
* [USB-RJ45](USB-RJ45/README.md)
* [USB/mini](USBmini/README.md)
