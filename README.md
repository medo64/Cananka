Cananka allows for the computer control of a CAN bus. The control of device is
possible via serial port (SLCAN compatible, Windows/Linux) or via SocketCAN
network driver (Linux). More information about the SLCAN protocol is available
in a [separate document](PROTOCOL.md).

* USB serial device supporting SLCAN interface

* Fully isolated (1 kV)
* Does not require CAN bus power supply (onboard DC-to-DC converter)

* USB 2.0 interface (type B)

There are alternative versions available too:
* [Mini](README-Mini.md) (directly pluggable, non-insulated, and without a case)
