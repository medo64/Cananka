1/2" heat-shrink tubing, 50mm

WARNING: This is a non-isolated board - beware of ground loops and all the fun
that can happen with different ground potentials.


#### UART Configuration ####

In order to configure the device, one has to use MCP2221 Utility application
(download from Microchip). In configuration, one MUST perform the following
changes:

    * GP1: 1 (CLK_OUT)

The following changes are suggested:

    * Required Current: 100 mA (minimum)
    * Descriptor: Cananka
    * Manufacturer: Medo64
    * Enumerate with serial number: Yes

All other settings should remain default.


#### JP1 ####

For testing purposes, it is possible to power other devices from 5V USB
connection. However, considering CAN bus is usually 12V based, this is
definitely not a recommendation. If one wants to have 5V output on CAN
connector, solder a SOD123FL diode at this location.
